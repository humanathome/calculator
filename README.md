## The Odin Project: Calculator
This is the [final project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) from the **Foundations** section.

### Assignment

- make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- make functions for all the basic math operations - add, subtract, multiply, divide
- create a new function `operate` that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers
- create buttons for each digit, each of the above functions and an 'equals' key
- there should also be a display for the calculator; create functions that populate the display when you click the number buttons

### Things to watch out for

- calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Users should be able to string together 
several operations and get the right answer
- be sure to round answers with long decimals so that they donâ€™t overflow the screen
- pressing `=` before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems
- division by 0
- pressing `clear` should wipe out any existing data

### Extra credit
- add decimal numbers support
- add 'backspace' button
- add keyboard support
- add CSS styling
